Ever thought about how paper-clips were manufactured before?

Me neither.

However, after being transfixed by the above animation, I consider myself
enlightened. Whilst hypnotized by the endless stationery production, it got me
thinking about how the purest and simplest solutions are the best.

Reading more about what transpired to be [Occam's Razor][occam-wiki], it rings
true with so many software development principles, from Agile to the <abbr
title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> approach.

The misconception that the best contribution to the business a developer can
make is head down, headphones on and churning out lines of code - is a
dangerous one.

All code has to be maintained. The legacy costs of maintaining and extending
before ultimately having to re-factor one over-zealous developer's afternoon
contribution, can far exceed the time taken to create the initial problem.

Solutions need to be elegant, simple and flexible enough to change with
requirements. They should accomplish a lot with a little, like a paper-clip
manufacturing machine.
