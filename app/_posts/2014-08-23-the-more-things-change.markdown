I've just finished a complete refactor of this site, you'd have barely noticed
as the design has remained largely intact. However, under the hood I'm rather
pleased with how lean and structured the app is looking.

I could (and have been known to) bore people going into this in much greater
depth, but I figure if you're interested in these things, you'd be better off
[taking a peek at the code](http://github.com/oller/davidollerhead.com) for
yourself.

I encountered a few problems along the way, which has given me some potential
blog post topics.  In the meantime, I intend to continue to develop this and
use it as a playground to implement new designs, patterns and technologies.

Now, to get to work on the [PageSpeed score](https://developers.google.com/spe
