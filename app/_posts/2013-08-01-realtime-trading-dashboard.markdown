Briefed on creating a real-time trading dashboard to be displayed on flatscreens throughout an office space, giving all staff an insight into a marketplace's activity and performance in realtime.

Stockshifters is Europe's fastest growing marketplace for wholesale, clearance and surplus stock. With a trade community of more than 100,000 members, Stockshifters works with some of the UKs top retailers, SME retailers, E-tailers and trade distributors to deliver efficiencies to the way buyers and suppliers trade goods.

Dashboard data is generated by a series of queries using the Zend / Doctrine Framework.  The front use's a regular `$.getJSON` ajax request to seamlessly update and populate the dashboard, whilst also transitioning and looping between a number of views.
