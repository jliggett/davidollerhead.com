#My Portfolio Site

The portfolio site of David Ollerhead.

##Get Going...

As jekyll is written in ruby, assuming you've ruby installed (OS X ships with it), but you may want to use [RVM](http://rvm.io) to manage your ruby environments.  We use [bundler](http://bundler.io/) to manage dependencies

`gem install bundler`

Then let bundler manage and install the dependencies specified in the `Gemfile`

`bundle install`

Finally fire up jekyll to serve up the site locally and watch for changes to trigger a recompile

`jekyll serve --watch`
