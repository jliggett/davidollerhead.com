Another iteration of my portfolio site, this time with jekyll.

Rebuilt using [Yeoman](http://wwwy.yeoman.io) and the excellent [Jekyll-rb generator](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb)

## Get going

First, let's all install all the dependencies

```bash
bundle install
npm install
bower install
```

Now we can get grunt to do the heavy lifting.

## Grunt Workflow

#### grunt serve

Compiles all files and opens the site in your default browser. A watch task watches for changes to files, recompiles if necessary, and injects the changes into the browser with LiveReload.

#### grunt check

Checks code quality with Jshint and CSS Lint, and Jekyll health with `jekyll doctor`.

#### grunt build

Builds an optimized site to the dist directory. [Usemin blocks](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin#the-useminprepare-task) are concatenated, [CSS](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin), [images](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-imagemin), and [HTML](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-htmlmin) are minified, [JavaScript is uglified](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify), and assets are [revved](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-filerev) for cache busting.

`grunt serve:dist` will run `grunt build` and open the result in your default browser

#### grunt deploy

During scaffolding the generator gives you the option to configure [grunt-build-control](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/grunt-build-control) to version and deploy your built code to a remote repository. If you configure build-control, `grunt deploy` will run `grunt check`, `grunt test`, `grunt build`, and then commit and deploy your built code to the specified remote repository. 

#### grunt (default)

`grunt` on its own is a special task that runs `grunt check`, any tests you've added, and `grunt build`.
